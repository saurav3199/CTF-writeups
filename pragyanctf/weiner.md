# Description:

Rabin has received a text from someone special, but it's all in ciphertext and he is unable to make head or tail of it. He requested her for a little hint, and she sent him the encryption algorithm. He's still unable to decode the text. Not wanting to look dumb to her again, he needs your help in figuring out what she's written for him. So help him out.
